# Java OOP Practice Questions

This repository contains a collection of Java practice problems focused on core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. I created this project to practice and solidify my understanding of OOP principles.

## Topics Covered

The practice tasks are organized into packages based on the main OOP topics:

* **Java Basics:** Fundamental syntax and logic tasks.
* **Encapsulation:** Exercises on data hiding, using private fields with public getters and setters.
* **Inheritance and Composition:** Problems exploring "is-a" (inheritance) versus "has-a" (composition) relationships.
* **Interfaces:** Tasks focused on implementing contracts and achieving full abstraction.
* **Polymorphism and Abstract Classes:** Exercises demonstrating dynamic method dispatch, method overriding, and partial implementation.

## Project Structure

The project's source code is organized by concept within the `src` directory:
